== Description ==

**Chatra Live Chat + ChatBot + Facebook + Helpdesk + Cart Saver.**

Chatra Live Chat allows you to sell more, answering questions and alleviating concerns to help visitors place an order. Use it to collect actionable feedback to improve your store: identify problems, collect contact info and understand your customers better.

Work from a web dashboard or desktop apps for Windows & Mac. Chat on the go from iOS/Android apps.

**Distinctive Features:**

* **Real-time visitor list.** View the list of visitors who are currently online on your website and start a conversation manually.
* **ChatBots.** Use bots to collect visitors’ contacts. Offer quick options for frequently asked questions (FAQ) so that your visitors get the answers they need without a load on your team.
* **Unique exit-intent feature.** Catch visitors who are about to leave!
* **Email integration.** Connect the email address your customers use to contact you and manage your email conversations alongside chats.
* **Facebook integration.** Send and receive chats directly from your Facebook visitors
* **Intelligent form bot.** Add your own custom fields (like company name, address or order number) to the contact form and dialogs.
* **Live typing insights.** See what customers type before they hit "send". Save time on preparing an answer.
* **Group chats.** Make few agents talk to a customer in a group chat to solve pressing issues and delight with the level of service.
* **Visitor information.** Know your customers — what page they are on, where are they from and what device and system they use to access your store.
* **Conversation history.** We save past conversations for both you and your customers, so once they return the conversation continues in the same thread, as in a messenger app.
* **Collects contact info.** Even when you are offline or unavailable, so that you can get back to customers even if they left your site.
* **Targeted chats (triggers).** Initiate conversations when certain criteria are met: target those customers who might be in need of assistance.
* **Correct typos.** Correct answers after sending the message.
* **Works everywhere.** Never lose a customer again. Even if he’s on Nintendo 3DS or a Windows Phone.
* **Looks & feels as a messenger app.** Smooth animations, avatars, beautiful design.
* **Agent photos visible pre-chat.** After clicking on the widget, visitors can see photos and names of the online agents, even before they start chatting. This is highly engaging and can lift a number of quality chat interactions.
* **Full Ecwid support.**
* **Full Woocommerce support.**
* **Work from a browser, desktop or mobile apps.** Windows & Mac, Android & iOS. Even on the go we’ve got you covered!
